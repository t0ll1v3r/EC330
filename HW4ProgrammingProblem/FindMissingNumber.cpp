/*
This algorithm finds the missing number in an array with numbers 0 to n with one missing.
The algorithm works by analyzing each bit of the numbers in the array and comparing it with the expected number of 1's at each bit position.
The missing number is reconstructed by checking discrepancies bit by bit. Overall runtime is Î˜(nlog(n)) since each number is checked bit by bit.
