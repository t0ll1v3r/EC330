## For Readers

`Problem4.cpp` is the program I created. To run the program, save the file to your device along with two input files (e.g., `words1.txt` and `words2.txt`). Open a terminal in the folder where you saved the files and run the following command to compile the program (Note that "mergeProgram" is the name of the executable file, feel free to choose any name): `g++ -o mergeProgram Problem4.cpp`.
Then, execute the program with the following command, passing the two input files as arguments: a./mergeProgram words1.txt words2.txt`
This will run the program and create an output file named output.txt, which will contain the merged and alphabetically sorted content of the two input files. Ensure that the input files (words1.txt and words2.txt) contain one word per line in alphabetical order before running the program.
